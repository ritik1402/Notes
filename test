✅ Intermediate Animation Ideas
Animated Delete

Animate note fading out + shrinking on delete using exit={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.5 }} with AnimatePresence.

Editing Mode Transition

Use smooth crossfade between the note view and the input form when editing.

Lottie Add/Empty State

Use Lottie animation:

When no notes: show an empty state animation (e.g., “No Notes Found”).

When a note is added successfully: brief success animation.

Expand on Click

Notes expand vertically to show full content with animation when clicked.

✅ Advanced Animation Ideas
Drag-and-Drop Reordering

Implement drag-to-reorder functionality using Framer Motion’s drag and layout.

3D Rotate on Flip

When editing, the card flips 180° (like a card flip) to reveal the input field.

Confetti Lottie Animation

Show confetti using Lottie on first note added or after a certain milestone (e.g., 10 notes).

Page Transition Animation

If you build separate pages (e.g., Dashboard, Notes), animate them with slide or fade transitions.

Animated Background

Subtly animated background or gradient waves using Lottie or SVG-based animated backgrounds.

✅ Bonus: Microinteractions
Input focus glow: Animate border shadow when input is focused.

Button loading spinner: Lottie spinner while saving or editing.

Delete shake warning: Brief shake on delete confirmation if needed.
