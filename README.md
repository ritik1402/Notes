## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/smart-notes.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd smart-notes

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server

🧠 How It Works
Notes are saved in the browser's localStorage so they remain even after refresh.

Each action (add/edit/delete) is animated for a better UX.

UI components are styled with Tailwind and enhanced using Framer Motion.
